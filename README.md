As suggested, I went through the Rasa tutorial and the Rasa masterclass to understand the Rasa framework. I have uploaded the files here and I have taken care of the specific issues mentioned by the team, like-
-(if the user says "I want to book a room for 2 people", the bot should not ask "How many rooms would you like to book?"),
-(Schedule cleaning using relative time),
-(including all the faqs),
-(including greeting messages).
However, I apologize for not being able to include the bonus section. Initially, I tried to keep it simple and later realized I would need custom actions for the bonus section.
I'm willing to include the bonus section if I get little more time, nontheless, the last three days were an amazing experience learning the Rasa framework and building the chatbot.
Thank you Team Limechat!
